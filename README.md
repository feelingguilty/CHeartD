# Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to take patient data as input and accurately predict the risk of CHD, aiding in early detection and prevention strategies.

## Model Development
- **Data Collection**: Data on patient demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors were collected from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered features from the raw data to capture meaningful information that could improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Utilized various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and others to train the prediction model.

## Features
The model takes the following features into account for CHD prediction:
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient.
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels.
- **Smoking Status**: Whether the patient is a smoker or not.
- **Diabetes**: Whether the patient has diabetes or not.
- **Family History**: Family history of heart disease.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The trained model achieves 75 percent. Users can input patient data and receive an estimated risk of CHD, helping in early detection and prevention strategies.

## Future Improvements
- Include more features such as dietary habits, exercise routine, and stress levels for better predictions.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks and ensemble methods for potentially higher accuracy.
- Incorporate real-time data integration for continuous monitoring of CHD risk.
